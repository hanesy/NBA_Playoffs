                <h4><b> Introduction </h4></b>
                    <p>For our final project, we decided to predict the teams that would have made it do the playoffs in the current season 2019-2020. We used historical data since 1979 to base our predicition.
                    </p>
                    <p>In doing this, we decided to choose a "modern" subset of Olympic Games, ranging from 1960 to 2016 to align with our economic and demographic data. As there is a larger breadth of competing countries in this range and a better record of population and wealth statistics.</p>

                <h4><b> NBA History </h4></b>
                    <b><p>Why we chose 1979:</p></b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Country names and boundaries have changed in the last sixty years.  As an example: if you are looking for the full Olympic history of a country that was renamed - like Russia - you will need to look for both the Soviet Union and Russia.
                            </li>
                            <li>Not all countries have competed in both the Summer and Winter Olympics, and thus you may see some "blank" graphs due to non-participation.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <b><p>Rule changes (timeline)</p></b>
